# What is the angle of rotation and how is it related to angular velocity and angular acceleration.

<br>
$Angle\,of\,rotation$ $(\theta)$  is defined as the angle between the $rotational\, motion\, axis$ (i.e is the axis upon which a rotational body rotates) and the axis which is perpendicular to it.
<br>
<br>
Here $\Theta$ represents the $angle\,of\,rotation$, which is measured in <b>radians</b> alongside the $x-axis$ (which is the $rotational\,motion\,axis$).
<br>
<br>
Suppose if $1\,revolution$ equals to $360\degree$ then we can represent the $angle\,of\,rotation$ for $1\,revolution$ in radians as:
$$1\,revolution= 360\degree = 2\pi\,radians$$

The relationship between $angle\,of\,rotation\,(\theta)$ and $arc\_length$ $(s)$ and $radius\,(r)$ is given as:

$$\theta=\frac{s}{r}$$
