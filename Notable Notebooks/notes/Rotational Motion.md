# Rotational Motion

## Meaning of the angle of rotation

<b>Angle of rotation</b> ($\Theta$)  is defined as the angle between the spinning motion axis and the axis which is perpendicular to it.

Here $\Theta$ represents the <b>angle of rotation</b>, which is measured in radians alongside the $x-axis$ (which is the spinning axis).

Suppose if $1\,revolution$ equals to $360\degree$ then we can represent the angle of rotation for $1\,revolution$ in radians as:
$$1\,revolution= 360\degree = 2\pi\,radians$$
